# WDGWatch (aka PipBoy-3000) — T-Watch Ultra Firmware

Custom firmware for **LilyGO T-Watch Ultra** (ESP32-S3, 410×502 AMOLED) turning
it into a Pip-Boy-styled multi-role device and wearable companion for the
**Watch Dogs Go** uConsole game.

- Standalone smartwatch (time, battery, GPS, compass, sensors)
- Security research tool (WiFi recon, BLE scan with AirTag detection, NFC reader, LoRa MeshCore)
- Wearable companion for the **Watch Dogs Go** uConsole game (BLE NUS link)
- Remote-controllable from phone via built-in SoftAP + web UI on `192.168.4.1`

Codename / SoftAP name stays **`PipBoy-3000`** (password `pip12345`). Project
name **WDGWatch** — Watch Dogs Go Watch.

Theme colour: `#00E5FF` cyan (matches [WatchDogsGo portal](https://locosp.github.io/WatchDogsGo/)).

### Unstable / known limitations

- **NFC card emulation** — ST25R3916 chip supports it but LilyGO antenna design is
  reader-only; tag emulation code is present but does not transmit. Do not use.
- **Evil Twin captive portal** — AP starts but there is no captive portal HTML
  yet. Credentials not captured.
- **LoRa range at SF8 BW62.5k** — tuned for MeshCore compatibility, not long-range.
  Typical urban range ~200 m LOS.
- **Compass drift** — uses `GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR` (no magnetometer fusion); manual
  one-time north calibration required, saved in NVS.
- **BLE scan + WiFi AP concurrency** — stable in short bursts; don't run BLE scan
  while heavy Web UI traffic is going.
- **PIN pairing on MacOS** — macOS auto-prompts, but on some versions the prompt
  appears on Bluetooth preference pane, not inline.

- ST25R3916 NFC
- SX1262 LoRa @ 869.618 MHz

## Build & flash

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LOCOSP/WDGWatch.git
cd WDGWatch
pio run --target upload          # builds + flashes via USB
pio device monitor --baud 115200
```

Default serial device on macOS: `/dev/cu.usbmodem101`. On Linux typically
`/dev/ttyACM0`.

If the watch boots into ROM download mode (rst reason `0x15` + `boot:0x23`),
press the side button (RST) or re-run `pio run --target upload`.

---

## Flow: enable Web Interface from phone

1. On the watch, navigate to the app menu (swipe from watchface).
2. Open **WiFi** app.
3. Tap **WEB SERVER** button → watch starts SoftAP `PipBoy-3000` with WPA2
   password `pip12345`.
4. Status bar shows `WEB SERVER ON` + AP IP (always `192.168.4.1`).
5. On phone, connect to WiFi `PipBoy-3000` (ignore "no internet" warning).
6. Open browser → `http://192.168.4.1`.
7. Tabs: **DASH / NFC / LORA / WiFi / RECON / SET**.
8. To turn off: return to WiFi app on watch, tap button again.

The web server survives backgrounding; NTP, GPS, NFC and LoRa keep working
while web UI is up.

## Flow: pair with Watch Dogs Go game (uConsole, BLE)

**First connection (PIN required):**

1. On the watch, open **WiFi** app → tap **WATCH DOGS CONNECT** (BLE toggle).
2. Watch advertises as `PipBoy-xxxxx` (unique 5-char suffix from MAC), prints
   `[BLE] Advertising` and `[BLE] PIN: 123456` on serial.
3. In the game on uConsole, start pairing / scan.
4. When the game attempts to subscribe or write to the NUS service, it gets
   **Insufficient Authentication (0x05)**. BlueZ then requests a passkey.
5. Watch shows a full-screen **BLE PAIRING** overlay with huge 48px PIN digits
   (6 digits, max brightness).
6. User reads PIN, enters it on the uConsole.
7. Bond is stored on both sides. Watch serial: `[BLE] Auth OK - encrypted`.
8. Watch switches to **WATCH_DOGS** overlay (skull + "L I N K E D" + clock,
   brightness dimmed to 20).

**Subsequent connections:**

Silent — bond is reused. Skull overlay appears immediately after the game
connects. Disconnect (range, crash, deliberate) hides the overlay and restores
default brightness.

**Bond reset:** `pio run -t erase` on the watch, or `bluetoothctl remove <MAC>`
on uConsole — either side triggers fresh pairing on next connection.

Detailed integration recipe for the game developer: see
[`BLE_PAIRING_CHANGE.md`](BLE_PAIRING_CHANGE.md) (BlueZ Agent example,
bluetoothctl pre-pair workflow, IO capability requirements).

## Flow: send LoRa MeshCore message

1. On watch LoRa app or web UI LORA tab: tap **START RX**.
2. Radio powers up, tunes to 869.618 MHz / SF8 / BW62.5 / CR5 / sync 0x1424
   (MeshCore public channel).
3. Type message → **SEND** (watch) or textarea + SEND button (web).
4. TX packet: group text with per-message HMAC-SHA256 auth (32-byte PSK
   padded to 32). Unix epoch timestamp. TX complete in 200–400 ms.
5. Other MeshCore nodes on the same PSK decode and display.
6. Received messages buzz the haptic, append to on-watch list, and push to web
   chat via WebSocket.
7. Last 20 messages persisted to `/meshcore_log.txt` on SD, reloaded on boot.

**Advertise node presence:** tap **ADVERTISE** — sends signed advert with node
name, optional GPS, Ed25519 pubkey. Signed with Orlp ed25519 (same stack as
stock MeshCore firmware).

## Web UI tabs — brief

- **DASH** — time, date, battery, GPS fix, NTP status, free heap, uptime,
  HAPTIC TEST + MAX BRIGHT shortcuts.
- **NFC** — SCAN TAG (enables reader), shows last UID / NDEF text, SAVE TAG
  (persists to SD + auto-export Flipper Zero v4 `.nfc`), list of saved tags
  with DELETE, EXPORT ALL button.
- **LORA** — MeshCore START/STOP, public channel chat (type + SEND),
  ADVERTISE button, message list loaded from SD history.
- **WiFi** — basic 2.4 GHz network list (SSID / RSSI / channel). Force NTP
  sync button.
- **RECON** — SCAN WiFi (with auth type, BSSID), SCAN BLE (with AirTag
  flag), BLACKOUT (deauth all channels), SNIFFER, DEAUTH DETECT (passive),
  EVIL TWIN (custom SSID AP), targeted DEAUTH (click network to autofill
  BSSID/channel).
- **SET** — brightness slider, GPS/NFC/Haptic toggles, watchface next/prev,
  REBOOT WATCH.

## Unified JSON API

Same command vocabulary over **BLE UART** (Nordic UART Service,
`6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`) and **HTTP** (`POST /api/cmd` with
`cmd=<JSON string>` form-encoded body).

```json
{"cmd":"status"}                          → {"type":"status","time":...,"bat":87,...}
{"cmd":"version"}                         → {"version":"PipBoy-3000 v0.3",...}
{"cmd":"haptic"}                          → {"ok":true}
{"cmd":"brightness","params":{"v":200}}   → {"ok":true}
{"cmd":"recon_wifi"}                      → {"ok":true,"msg":"wifi scanning"}
{"cmd":"recon_ble","params":{"duration":10}} → {"ok":true,"msg":"ble scanning"}
{"cmd":"recon_results"}                   → {"wifi":[...],"ble":[...]}
{"cmd":"nfc_scan"} / nfc_stop / nfc_save  → {"ok":true}
{"cmd":"lora_send","params":{"text":"hi"}} → {"ok":true}
{"cmd":"compass"}                         → {"heading":123.4,"calibrated":true}
{"cmd":"sensor_data"}                     → {"accel":[...],"gyro":[...],...}
```

Events auto-pushed from watch to both BLE and Web clients:

```json
{"event":"scan_done","wifi":26,"ble":24}
{"event":"lora_msg","channel":"public","text":"...","hops":1,"rssi":-87,"ts":...}
{"event":"nfc_tag","uid":"04:AB:...","ndef":"..."}
{"event":"deauth_detected","count":3}
```
