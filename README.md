An advanced, feature-rich custom firmware for the **LilyGO T-Watch S3 Ultra** (ESP32-S3, 410×502 AMOLED), rebranded as the **SCR Terminal**. It turns your wearable into a retro-cybernetic terminal device, serving as a tactical security research tool, a virtual pet keeper, and a companion for the **Watch Dogs Go** mesh ecosystem.

---

## 🚀 Key Features in Detail (English)

### 1. 🔒 Retro Boot Sequence & Gesture Lock
When the device boots, it initiates a high-fidelity **Retro Terminal Sequence** simulating:
*   RAM and ROM integrity tests.
*   Hardware peripheral discovery (NFC transceiver, LoRa transceiver, BHI260AP IMU, GPS).
*   SD card mount checks.
*   **Safety Lock:** Touchscreen swipe gestures are completely disabled during the boot animation, preventing menu access until all systems are checked and initialized.

### 2. 👾 SCR-Bit Virtual Pet (Terminal Droid)
A Tamagotchi-style virtual pet living directly on your wrist:
*   **Evolutionary Path:** Starts as a basic **Microchip** (Level 1) with gold contact pins. Upon reaching 100% XP, it evolves into an animated **Droid** (Level 2) featuring tread tracks, a flashing LED antenna, and dynamic arms.
*   **0% Background Battery Usage:** Rather than using blocking loops or CPU tasks that drain the watch battery, SCR-Bit uses **RTC Time-Delta Calculations**. When the application is closed or the watch is sleeping, parameters (Health, Energy, Cleanliness) decay mathematically based on elapsed time saved in NVS preferences.
*   **Interactive Controls / Web UI Interaction (Web UI):** 
    *   `FEED`: Injects code packets to restore energy. *(Available via Web UI)*
    *   `HEAL`: Calibrates the kernel to restore health. *(Available via Web UI)*
    *   `CLEAN`: Sweeps up wire poop scraps (`~=`) that spawn when cleanliness drops below 50%. *(Available via Web UI)*
    *   `STATUS`: Prints real-time system logs to the scrollable green terminal console at the bottom. *(Status monitored via Web UI)*

### 3. 📡 Tactical RF Jammer & Tesla Port
Leverages the onboard SX1262 transceiver to provide RF security research tools:
*   **Locked Preset Timers:** The RF Jammer cannot be launched without first selecting a duration preset (`10s`, `20s`, `30s`, `1m`, `3m`, or `5m`) **(Web UI)**.
*   **Dynamic Countdown:** When active, the screen locks onto a glowing red warning status displaying a real-time countdown timer.
*   **Tesla Port:** Sends a single-pass RF burst signal mapped to common automotive diagnostic frequencies for authorized testing **(Web UI)**.

### 4. 🛜 WiFi Recon, BLE Hunting & Timezone Management
*   **WiFi Sniffing & Deauth:** Scans 2.4GHz channels, lists active BSSIDs, displays RSSI, and allows targeting individual APs for authorized deauthentication or broad blackout tests **(Web UI)**.
*   **BLE Tracker:** Searches for nearby Bluetooth Low Energy devices and actively checks manufacturer data payloads to flag Apple AirTags or other trackers **(Web UI)**.
*   **Dynamic Timezone Configuration:** WiFi menu includes a **CLOCK** button. When connected to WiFi, users can select from 38 global cities to configure the system timezone. Timezone is persisted in NVS and automatically triggers an NTP re-sync to apply local time offset and DST rules.

### 5. 🌌 Multi-Protocol LoRa & FSK Radio Integration
The device utilizes the onboard SX1262 transceiver to interface with multiple decentralized radio networks and paging protocols:

*   **Auto-Refresh:** The panel automatically refreshes every 30 seconds while open.
*   **Offline Graceful Degradation:** If GPS has no fix or WiFi is unavailable, the panel displays a clear error status instead of crashing.

### 10. 🦋 Bit-Gotchi Recon Agent (Passive Handshake Hunter)
The SCR-Bit virtual pet evolves into an autonomous cyber-recon agent via the **Politician** passive capture engine:
*   **Passive EAPOL/PMKID Capture:** Activating **BIT-GOTCHI** mode enables autonomous channel hopping and WPA handshake capture without sending any deauth frames. All captured handshakes are saved as `.pcap` files inside a `/bit` directory on the SD card.
*   **SD Log Loot Modal:** A dedicated **SD LOG LOOT** button (below the console) opens an on-device file browser listing all captured `.pcap` files with their sizes.
*   **Butterfly Catch Animation:** When a new handshake is captured, the pet displays a butterfly net animation (`Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ 🕸️`) for 3 seconds, gains +15 Energy and +25 XP, triggers haptic feedback, and auto-saves state to NVS.
*   **Detective Hat Overlay:** The pet wears a `🎩` detective hat while BIT-GOTCHI mode is active — it disappears when the mode is turned off.
*   **Achievement Badge System (persistent via NVS):**
    *   `🐾 First Step` — Unlocked on the first captured handshake.
    *   `🕵️ Silent Detective` — Unlocked after 5 total captures.
    *   `🏹 PMKID Hunter` — Unlocked when a PMKID packet is captured.

## 🔵 Bluetooth Terminal Connection Guide (English)

The **SCR Terminal** exposes a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Serial Interface using the **Nordic UART Service (NUS)** protocol. You can use any BLE Terminal App (e.g., *Serial Bluetooth Terminal* on Android, *Bluefy* on iOS, or `bluetoothctl` on Linux) to send JSON commands and receive asynchronous system events.

#### How to Connect:
1. Open the **WiFi** application on the watch.
2. Tap the **WATCH DOGS CONNECT** button to enable BLE.
3. The watch status bar will display `BLE ON` and print a unique 6-digit **BLE PIN** on the serial console or a fullscreen pairing overlay.
4. Open your BLE Terminal app on your phone/PC and scan for devices.
5. Connect to the device named **`PipBoy-xxxxx`** (where `xxxxx` is a unique suffix from the MAC address).
6. Enter the 6-digit PIN displayed on the watch screen when prompted by your system.
7. Once paired, the watch displays the **WATCH_DOGS** skull screen and dims brightness.
8. Set your BLE terminal app to use **`\n` (newline / LF)** as the end-of-line character (all JSON commands must end with `\n`).
9. Send any command from the API list above (e.g., `{"cmd":"status"}\n`).

## 🔵 Bluetooth Terminal Bağlantı Kılavuzu (Türkçe)

**SCR Terminal**, **Nordic UART Service (NUS)** protokolünü kullanarak Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) üzerinden çalışan bir kablosuz seri terminal sunar. Herhangi bir BLE Terminal uygulaması (örneğin Android'de *Serial Bluetooth Terminal*, iOS'ta *Bluefy* veya Linux'ta `bluetoothctl`) kullanarak cihaza JSON komutları gönderebilir ve sistem durum loglarını canlı olarak alabilirsiniz.

#### Nasıl Bağlanılır:
1. Saatteki **WiFi** uygulamasını açın.
2. BLE modülünü aktif hale getirmek için **WATCH DOGS CONNECT** butonuna dokunun.
3. Saat ekranında `BLE ON` yazısı görünecektir. Cihaz ilk kez eşleşiyorsa ekranda 6 haneli **BLE PIN** kodu belirecektir.
4. Telefon veya bilgisayarınızdaki BLE Terminal uygulamasını açarak tarama yapın.
5. **`PipBoy-xxxxx`** (buradaki `xxxxx` MAC adresine özel benzersiz koddur) isimli cihaza bağlanın.
6. Bağlantı esnasında telefon/PC ekranında şifre istendiğinde, saat ekranındaki 6 haneli PIN kodunu girin.
7. Eşleşme tamamlandığında saat ekranı **WATCH_DOGS** kuru kafa görseline geçecek ve parlaklığı kısacaktır.
8. Terminal uygulamanızın satır sonu karakterini **`\n` (LF / satır sonu)** olarak ayarlayın (JSON komutları `\n` ile sonlanmak zorundadır).
9. Yukarıdaki API listesinde yer alan herhangi bir komutu gönderin (örneğin: `{"cmd":"status"}\n`).
